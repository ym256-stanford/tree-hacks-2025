Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) is a sophisticated dimensionality reduction technique that leverages singular value decomposition (SVD) to unearth latent structures within high-dimensional textual corpora. By mapping terms and documents into a lower-dimensional latent semantic space, LSI mitigates the lexical mismatches inherent in traditional keyword-based retrieval paradigms. This method captures the underlying semantic associations between terms, enabling more robust retrieval performance even in the presence of synonymy and polysemy. The mathematical underpinnings of LSI facilitate the identification of principal components that best encapsulate the variance in term distributions, thus optimizing vector representations for document-query similarity computations. Despite its computational complexity, LSI remains a foundational approach in text mining and information retrieval, forming the basis for more advanced neural embedding models.
